# code-oss-installer
This is just an easy install for code-oss, from code.headmelted.com, and is basically an edited version of VS Code for a raspberry pi. This can only be run from a distro with apt installed. The install can be run with this command:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmlisowski/code-oss-installer/master/install-apt.sh | sudo bash
